#Preparing OpenStack for Kubo

This topic describes how to prepare OpenStack for Kubo.

##Prerequisites

You must have the following to install Kubo on OpenStack:

1. An OpenStack environment running one of the following supported releases:

    - [Mitaka](http://www.openstack.org/software/mitaka)

    	!!! note
    		The Kubo team actively tests on Mitaka.
    
    - [Liberty](http://www.openstack.org/software/liberty)
    - [Newton](http://www.openstack.org/software/newton)

1. The following OpenStack services:
   
    - [Identity](https://www.openstack.org/software/project-navigator#security)
    - [Compute](https://www.openstack.org/software/project-navigator#compute)
    - [Image](https://www.openstack.org/software/project-navigator#compute)
    - *(Recommended)* [OpenStack Networking](https://www.openstack.org/software/project-navigator#networking), which provides network scaling and automated management functions

	!!! note
		Nova networking is known to work, but the Kubo team does not actively test it because it is deprecated.
		    
1. An existing OpenStack project

1. A network configured to allow the following:
    - Incoming TCP traffic on port 8443 for the Kubernetes API server 
    - Incoming TCP traffic for port range 30000â€”32765
    - Incoming UDP traffic for port 8285 within the Kubo network
    - Incoming TCP traffic for ports 8844 and 25555 for operators
    - Outgoing TCP traffic for port 53 within the Kubo network
   
    !!! tip
    	You can find the network settings in Compute > Access & Security, clicking the Manage Rules button for your security group.
    
	*(Optional)* If you plan to configure Cloud Foundry to handle routing for Kubo, the network must also allow the following:

    - Outgoing TCP traffic to Cloud Foundry routing API host and port
    - Outgoing TCP traffic to Cloud Foundry NATS hosts and port
    - Outgoing TCP traffic to Cloud Foundry router host and Kubo port

##Step 1: Deploy BOSH for Kubo on OpenStack

Deploy the BOSH Director for Kubo by following the procedures in the [Deploying BOSH for Kubo on OpenStack](deploying-bosh-openstack/) topic.

##Step 2: Deploy Kubo

After deploying BOSH for Kubo, continue to the [Deploying Kubo](../deploying-kubo/) topic to finish the Kubo installation.
