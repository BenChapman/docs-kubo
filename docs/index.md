This is the documentation for Cloud Foundry Container Runtime (CFCR), an open-source project that provides a solution for deploying and managing [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/) clusters using [BOSH](https://bosh.io/docs).

CFCR uses BOSH to improve the Kubernetes experience for both operators and developers. By leveraging BOSH, CFCR adds capabilities such as high availability, scaling, and self-healing to Kubernetes clusters.

CFCR was formerly known as Kubo, and many CFCR assets still use the Kubo name. CFCR does not require Cloud Foundry, but you can optionally configure a Cloud Foundry deployment to handle routing for CFCR.

See [What is CFCR?](./overview/what-is-cfcr/) to learn more.

## Installing and Configuring

**DEPRECATED**
>We no longer support the following strategies to deploy Bosh and CFCR. Please see [Bosh Bootloader](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-bootloader) on how to deploy Bosh and [CFCR Repository](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-release) to deploy CFCR.

The following topics describe how to install and configure CFCR on your cloud platform.
