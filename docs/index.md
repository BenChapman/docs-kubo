#Welcome to Kubo

This is the documentation for Kubo, an open-source project that provides a solution for deploying and managing [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/) clusters using [BOSH](https://bosh.io/docs).

Kubo uses BOSH to improve the Kubernetes experience for both operators and developers. By leveraging BOSH, Kubo adds capabilities such as high availability, scaling, and self-healing to Kubernetes clusters.

See [What is Kubo?](./overview/what-is-kubo/) to learn more about Kubo.
